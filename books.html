There are so many benefits of humming, you can literally heal any illness with just intention and humming. This book has helped me out so much on my journey of healing and transformation. I use humming to warm up to my singing and speaking and I also combine humming techniques with voice exercises to gradually open up my natural voice. I've explored many healing techniques during my journey of reconnecting with my true self and and I found humming to be one of the most effective and gentle ways to heal yourself.

The best book on communication I've ever read. A big part of life is the relationships we build with other people. How are you going to develop healthy relationships without knowing how to connect with people? The techniques go beyond your immediate circle of friends, you'll be able to connect with pretty much anybody if you really apply the techniques described in this book. Learning how to connect with people will help you create more abundance in any area of life you wish to explore.
