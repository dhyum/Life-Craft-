<h3 id="concentration">Concentration</h3>
<p>Concentration is an important trait for any human being. Concentration means doing one thing at a time with a complete focus on it. With the power of concentration, you can achieve anything.

Concentration is something that needs to be developed with practice. Not everyone can do it, and those who lack it generally find it difficult to complete a task perfectly. Concentration comes with the control of the mind. Once you understand and realize how your mind works, you will be able to control it.

Concentration helps you complete a task efficiently and quickly. You will be able to get more things done. And since it helps you get things done, it also helps in reducing unnecessary stress and pressure.

You can develop a concentration in many ways. Meditation is a very common way to do that since a calm mind is able to concentrate much more than a disturbed one. Trying to focus on a single thing at a time is another great way to develop concentration.

Concentration is a tool that is very useful in any situation. If you know how to concentrate on a single task then surely you will get it done.</p>

<h3 id="voice">Voice</h3>
<p>Our voice is our primary mean of communication, and most of us can’t go for more than a couple of minutes without using it.  We don’t use your voice for just talking though, our voice can be used to do a variation of things.  The most obvious example would be singing.  So it is obvious the human voice is a means of communication, but it is also a source of pleasure for us.  The human voice is not limited to just a couple sounds, no, the human voice can make a complex range of sounds  but none of this could be possible if it weren’t for the complex system you possess in your throat. First I’ll start off by talking about the physical components and how they contribute to the production of your voice.  There are only about 6 main…show more content…
To make sound our vocal cords are brought together.  After you bring them together they vibrate very quickly due to your airflow.  Air is one of the most important components that you need to be able to speak.  Air is your energy source to talk with.  The air is what causes the vocal cords to vibrate and oscillate in your throat.  Your breath is like your fuel, and without a proper supply one can’t speak properly.  The articulators are self explanatory.  Your teeth, tongue, lips, and palette help you form words.  How and when you positions each part determines the word you form and the sound you’ll make.  Now the human voice does not just have one sound and on pitch.  The human voice has a huge range of different pitches with which we can make sounds with.  As well the human voice can be projected louder or quieter depending on the amount of air used.  Now the pitch of a human voice can change for many different factors.  The higher the pitch of your voice is the faster your vocal cords are vibrating, and the lower your pitch the slower your vocal cords are vibrating.  It is also known that our emotions can affect the pitch of our voice.  Usually situations where a person is highly aroused, be it happy, or mad, it can limit the tension in your vocal cords and the position of your larynx.  This makes it harder for you to vary your pitch.  Usually happiness is attributed to a higher voice while angriness is

<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>Speak in Public.
People usually tend to view speaking in front of a crowd of people is a frightening situation because of many reasons. First, people do not practice speaking in public. They have not used to speak reasonably and choose proper words in daily conversations with their friends and families. So they fear to fail their first experience in front of a large audience. Second, People feel scared, uncomfortable, and alone when standing on a stage with everyone's eyes focused on them and judging them. These feelings make them nervous and unable to perform effectively. Finally, some people simply do not know how to write and prepare for a reasonable speech. Thus, they lose confidence and the flow of their speech.

The first time I spoke in front of my classmates, I was unconscious. I forgot writing the subject on the board at the beginning. During the class, I avoided looking at my mentor who was assessing my performance. When it was reciting time, I remained speechless for a few seconds. My mouth was dry. Finally, as I could recite, my voice came out deep and choked, but I continued carelessly. While engaging in my speech, "It is enough" said my mentor. Her words gave me goose bumps. I had not yet mentioned all the lecture points. Going to my seat, I became on the verge of tears. For the rest of the class period, I kept getting angrier with myself. Why did not I manage class's time effectively? I thought to myself. "Though there are few weaknesses in your class, it was a good effort." my mentor said. When I heard that, I felt comfortable and more enthusiastic to perform a better class later.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>The word communication has been derived from the Latin word communis which means common, besides commonality, communication involves the concept of transfer, meaning and information transfer. Thus communication means sharing ideas in common to one or many.

It means a verbal or written message, an change of information, a system of communicating, and a process by which meanings are exchanged between individuals/groups of individuals through a common system of symbols. It also means technique for expressing ideas effectively and quickly. </p>

<h3 id="awareness">Awareness</h3>
<p>Awareness is the ability to directly know and percieve, to feel, or to be cognizant of events. More broadly, it is the state of being conscious of something. Awareness is a relative concept. It may be focused on an internal state, such as a visceral feeling, or on external events by way of sensory perception</p>

<h3 id="breathing">Breathing</h3>
<p>Breathing deeply, with a slow and steady inhalation to exhalation ratio, signals our parasympathetic nervous system to calm the body down. Long, deep breaths can also manage our stress responses to help decrease anxiety, fear, racing thoughts, a rapid heartbeat and shallow chest breathing</p>
